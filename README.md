# HelpUs

## Summary.

HelpUs is the result of a design thinking process applied into the harrasment problematic, taking as insight the common perfil of men and woman who have been involved in these type of situations in Zacatecas. Often, men don't communicate the problem even to those closest to them, while women prefer to be counceled by real people and avoid burocratic process. Due to the lack of information many harrasment cases go unpunished.

HelpUs offers people an space where they can share their problems to know how other people have treated them and what experts recommends, and for those who prefer not to share their problems we provide a chat bot called Perry, trained for give advice on how to deal with distinct harrasment problems and how to report them.

## Results.

We got invited to participate in a forum to present our job. People got interested in the project in many ways, even an stakeholder looked at HelpUs a tool she could use in the process of assist legal harrasment reports. We talked about the opportunity of HelpUs to be an institutional system for the students to expose and report harrasment problems where teachers, students and institution related people get involved, so HelpUs could be changing directions for next releases.

## How can be improved?

Perry, the HelpUs bot, lacks of understanding some harrasment situations that fit into our categories, gets confused by some other situations and can't resolve ambiguous phrases by itself. All that problems are because an unsuccessful training phase. Although the first phrases written by ourselves helped us to release the bot, they weren't enough to span all objective groups. We invited people to talk the bot simulating a real execution environment, however, only near of 20% of the collected phrases were useful for us.

In order to solve training related problems, a more robust training phase is necessary. We can use Twitter and Facebook tools to get most common words and phrases people use to express harrasment situations.

Page content and user interface are crucial to success. In next releases we could be changing images, colors and text, and adding a new feature in which by using natural language understanding censure not appropiated comments.
